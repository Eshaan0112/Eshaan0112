## Introduction
Welcome to my Github profile!

I'm Eshaan Minocha, an Associate Data Scientist at The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. I graduated from Purdue University in May 2024 with a Master's in Computer Engineering. I have experience working in software development and machine learning. I also have a good understanding of end to end designing of ML applications and how they fit with system design in the industry.

**I’m currently looking for _Full time Early Career Machine Learning/Data Science/AI Engineering_ roles.**

You can find my most interesting projects and competitions in the pinned section of my profile. 

I am open to collaboration on research or projects in any field of Machine Learning. Please don't hesitate to reach out to me via my _email: eshaanminocha0112@gmail.com_
